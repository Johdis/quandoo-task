# Quandoo task

## How to execute the test

You can execute the test on each machine (Linux, Mac, Windows) by using docker.

[Please download and install docker here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

After installing just navigate in a terminal to the cloned repository and start the test with _**docker-compose run test_local**_

Everything what is not installed on your machine will be downloaded by docker and bundler.

After the execution you should use _**docker-compose down**_ to clear containers and the RAM of your machine.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
